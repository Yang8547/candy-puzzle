# candy-puzzle
a program to solve the Candy Crisis puzzle automatically in the shortest number of moves

Candy Crisis is a type of sliding puzzle played with 14 tokens representing different types of candies in a box. The box has 15 predetermined
positions arranged in a box of 3 rows and 5 columns.

Initially, the player is given a random arrangement of candies in it, and the goal of the game is to rearrange the candies
into a symmetrical arrangement by sliding them one at a time into the empty space. Only a candy directly next to the
empty space, not including diagonally, can be moved into it.

A symmetrical arrangement (a goal state) is one which is balanced around the middle row, and there are no constraints
on the middle row. In other words, if the top row is identical to the bottom row, then the puzzle is solved.


Play Modes

the program is able to run in manual mode and in automatic mode. 
1. Manual entry for the player, i.e. a human indicating the moves by hand.

2. Automatic mode, i.e.  “AI” solving and indicating the moves.
